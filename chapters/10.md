# The Knights' Choice

One of the knights approached me. They had gathered and wished for me to be present.

When I entered, they saluted. They told me they would serve their former masters no more and would abide by my choice in the matter of the dragon. As proof of their sincerity, they tore their badges away and cast off their two-color coats.

The nobles had already failed. They were the dregs of a collapsing civilization. The scholars cared for nothing beyond the Academy. If we were truly to rebuild, we needed to reach beyond Liurnia and recover what we could. And that would risk drawing the attention of the Lord of Frenzied Flame.

They were not sure about the dragon, but they knew the battle with the Lord would come eventually. Living god or not, we had no choice. I could teach them to protect against flame, and the Academy had experience with madness. With my leadership, they said, we stood a chance.

I grit my teeth. This was a turning point.

Yes, I said at last. But we would need more of my kind. I did not know if any of my brothers in faith had survived, but my wife and daughters were near enough if they yet lived.
