# Cavern of the Void

I awoke in a flooded cavern. Glowing fungi provided just enough light for me to paddle ahead. I felt no broken bones, but the impact of striking the water left me dearly sore. Paddling was all I could manage. Every so often, I would lie back and float.

Ironically, my former wife had saved me. After we had come to Liurnia, she had insisted we learn to swim. Every so often, I simply let go and floated. It was easy enough. I certainly felt like a floating corpse. It would have been better if my family had died after all.

The next cavern was larger. Strange clouds and false stars hung overhead, but I did not let myself be distracted. There was a tunnel on the far side where the water did not reach. I hauled myself ashore only with great effort. The robes of a Fire Monk are meant to keep body heat close, and they probably hold a greatshield's weight in water as a result.

I was safe, perhaps. The creatures of the Rot could not pass water until it was stagnant and rotten. I only hoped the uncontaminated mushrooms meant they could not reach this side of the cavern. I fell into a dreamless sleep.
