# Moonstruck

When the dragon descended, the scholars nearly wet themselves. Not from fear, as the nobles had. Their rapture was unnerving. They were all but cultists of the stars, watching the movements of the lesser lights like hawks. The moon, the greater sorcerous light, had always been a thing beyond them.

No matter how they entreated it, its light had only shone on rare champions. Their rebellion against the Carian royalty was out of envy as much as anything. Their lunar blessings trampled upon generations of hard work, the sacrifice of blood and sanity.

I had seen their heroes â€“ or what was left of them. Heads turned to glintstone and bodies shriveled to nothing. Not one equal to even Loretta, mere guard to the royal family.

This all-powerful moon which had denied them so long now came of her own will. So they fell to their knees and prayed like the faithful they detested.

Their shamelessness would serve me well. The regular soldiers were already leaning toward following the knights. The nobles would follow whichever path was more opportune. Only the scholars would have been a problem. Now they would come joyfully. I still resented being bound to the Academy as I was becoming, but I would require such infrastructure to complete my pact and wage war on the Lord.
